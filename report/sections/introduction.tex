\section{Introduction}

The aim of this report is to detail the work undertaken into implementing the calculation of statistical values from large datasets derived from natural processes. `Statistical values' was understood as descriptive statistics that summarise a data set through representative scalar values, such as minimum, mean, standard deviation. We took `natural processes' to mean a process that generates a data stream of continuous values with existing statistical values. Finally, the term `large data sets' was taken to mean anything that is inefficient to process through ordinary means, but still manageable on a shared-memory system as distributed systems are out of our scope (on the order of $10^9$, <10GiB).
